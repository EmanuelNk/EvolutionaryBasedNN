# EvolutionaryBasedNN 
Evolutionary implementation for a binary classification problem using NN (tensorflow Keras) 

In this project we train a Neural Network in an evolutionary way tonpredict the future state of the system as accurately as possible.
We train a model that predicts the future state of a real-time system.
We are given 120 features extracted from the past five minutes of the system running,
and have to predict whether in a minute from now the system will be in state 0 (negative)
or 1 (positive), i.e., binary classification.
